This is for the information that the repository has been excluded by the Hacktoberfest team from the event. This was done to maintain the quality standards and promote good quality open source contributions. 

**I apologize for making this repo as a source of making PRs not worth the standards of the Hacktoberfest.** It was an unintentional thing and I don't want to misguide anyone. Though **I didn't allow any spam**, checked the code, **made contributors raise issues and then make the PR, made them use the template properly** but I think the repo was misused. 

**My intention was good but it went in the wrong direction for the wrong kind of projects** 

I am making this repo an "archive".
