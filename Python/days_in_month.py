# Use list indexing to determine how many days are in a particular month based on the integer variable month, and store that value in the integer variable num_days. For example, if month is 8, num_days should be set to 31, since the eighth month, August, has 31 days.

# Remember to account for zero-based indexing!

month = 10
days_in_month = [31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31]

# use list indexing to determine the number of days in month
num_days = days_in_month[month -1]

print(num_days)
