### error? read comment below

> for PI and E you need to put any numbers just to prevent input error but write PI or E for operator.

> for FACTORIAL and TRIG you need to put zero (or any number) as the first number, then the sign and last the number you want to calculate. The first number (or the zero) will not be used for calculations but it will prevent an error
